Bounty Hunt
=====================

This project is a small web game created in the learning of some webdev techniques, originally this web 
page connected to a simple SQL database to store names and scores of players but as this server is no 
longer online this functionality is missing as of 05/05/2024. The game is simple, find the correct face in under 10 seconds the faster the better, 3 rounds.

=====================

This project is best used on the Firefox browser at 1080p or above, while functional on different resolutions
and browsers my skill at CSS is not yet good enough to figure out all the problems that are being caused on different browsers.
